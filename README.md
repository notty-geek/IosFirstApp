# Our objective

In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to create your very own “Hello, World!” application with Swift. It’s super simple and also can be kinda fun for those of you new to iOS programming.

You’ll learn how to create a project in Xcode and create an application that shows a “Hello World” greeting. When a user taps a button, the app will show a message. We will define a function and the function will be invoked when a button is clicked.

# Coding environment

If you want to develop and make iOS apps, you will need to download Xcode 10. Xcode is the IDE created by Apple that includes the tools, interface builder, editor, simulator, and test driven development we need to create our application in Swift. It’s great, powerful, minimalistic, and best part is we don’t really need anything else.

You do, however, you will need a Mac or computer running OS X to download the IDE. I would advise making sure you have enough space on your hardrive, as the only bummer is that it weighs in at a hefty 6 GB.
If you haven’t already, feel free to download it on iTunes or here on the developer site to follow along.

# Let’s get started!


Now that you have Xcode downloaded, let’s go ahead and open it up.
